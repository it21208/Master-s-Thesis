###### Implementation of the augmented RFMTC and RFM marketing predictive model using the programming language R in the RStudio IDE. Used multiple datasets (e.g. Blood Transfusion Dataset, CDNOW dataset, longstanding telecom customer data set). 

###### Functional and Modular programming and heavy usage of the CRAN package repository including optimisation methods (such as optim_nm, optim_sa, optimx, optim) for the minimisation of non-linear objective functions. 

###### Understanding of Geometric series, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Time Series, Bernoulli Trials Process and Churn Probability. 

###### The purpose of the research was to assert the generality of the RFMTC model as an improved more customizable alternative of the RFM and other ML algorithms such as (SVM, Random Forest, K-Means, etc.) and justify the additional implementation complexity of some model parameters (e.g. Time since first purchase or donation of a customer in a certain period and churn rate) as a productive one.
